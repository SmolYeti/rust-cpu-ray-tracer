# rust-cpu-ray-tracer
CPU Ray Tracer written in Rust so I can practice Rust

So far this is the implementation of books 1 & 2 of [*Ray Tracing: In One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io/) in Rust.

I also have added multi-threading & saving of PNGs through the libraries [**scoped_threadpool**](https://crates.io/crates/scoped_threadpool) and [**softbuffer**](https://github.com/rust-windowing/softbuffer).
